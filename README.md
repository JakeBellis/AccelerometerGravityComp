# AccelerometerGravityComp
Using a combined Accelerometer and Gyroscope, uses the readings to determine the portion of acceleration that's not due to gravity based on the orientation of the device

The paper for the algorithm used can be found at http://x-io.co.uk/res/doc/madgwick_internal_report.pdf

Hardware used:
Arduino Uno
TDK invensense icm-20948
